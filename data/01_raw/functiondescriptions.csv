Drink Cooler,Transfer thermal energy,Humans place the device on a surface and places a cup on top. Electrical energy is used to start mechanical rotation of a fan and extract heat. The fan expels air and the heat is transferred out.,https://berkeley.ca1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_cI94U4QdozyK8FE
DVD Player,Read a DVD,"Humans insert a DVD and turn on the player. Electrical energy is used to start mechanical rotation and the lens focuses electromagnetic energy (laser) on the moving disk to read it. The electromagnetic energy is changed to electrical energy, which is used to display the video and play audio. Buttons are used to control other actions such as pause and eject.",https://berkeley.ca1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_eQWuvS7BC29ZiXc
Nerf Gun,Export ammo,"Humans load the ammo, pump air into the gun, and pull a mechanical trigger. The pressurized air causes translational motion of the ammo and the gun emits noise.",https://berkeley.ca1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_9NvodztnvQEsJoy
Game Controller,Control computer,Humans push mechanical buttons or directional joysticks to actuate an electric signal. The electric signal is turned into a control signal that sends data to the connected electronic device as well as into electromagnetic energy (light) and mechanical vibration on the controller. ,https://berkeley.ca1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_bOv53T3gvs8Ivps
Power Razor,Separate hair from human,"Humans provide translational motion to the razor over the surface of their skin through their hands. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy in the razor to cut the hair and separate it from the surface of the skin. The razor releases the cut hair, heat, and noise.",https://berkeley.ca1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_3CyljF5jBoKn7NA
Stapler,Couple paper,Humans store staples in the stapler. Paper is positioned between the top and bottom housing of the stapler and force is applied to the top housing by the hand. The staple is separated from other staples and couples the sheets of paper together. The stapler releases the stapled pages and noise. ,https://berkeley.ca1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_3CwuejTVbndegkK
Hulk Hands,Emit sound for entertainment,Humans place their hands in the gloves. The gloves detect and process an electrical signal from human movement. The electrical signal is converted to noise.,https://berkeley.ca1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_3JzNpslYlphpHoy
Lawn Mower,Separate grass from ground,"Humans push the lawn mower to add translational motion and turn it on. Liquid fuel is stored and the chemical energy in it is converted to mechanical energy. The mechanical energy is used to cut the grass and expel the cut grass pieces. The lawn mower releases heat, noise, and fumes. ",https://berkeley.ca1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_cNIDxF2tHdlG9y6
Quick Grip Vise,Secure solid,Humans position the object and secure it by applying force to clamp it. ,https://berkeley.ca1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_0c6TnX9zLLUu54a
Scooter,Transfer human,Humans provide or stop translational motion to transport themselves.,https://berkeley.ca1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_cY2mlMr5V3IZVEW
VHS Player,Read a VHS tape,"Humans turn on the player insert the tape, which is sensed and then guided in. Electrical energy is used mechanically translate the tape and then to start mechanical rotation of the wheels. The magnetic tape reel is read and encoded into video and audio signals, which are played.  Electrical energy is also converted to electromagnetic energy (light) to indicate the status. Buttons are used to control other signals such as stop and eject. ",https://berkeley.ca1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_3fR4FhIr82jD82O
Vise Grip,Secure solid,"Humans position the object and secure it by applying force, changing its status from unclamped to clamped.",https://berkeley.ca1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_5pA9LPPszohtlQO
Water Pump,Move liquid,"Humans turn the pump on. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy and then to pressurized air within the pump, which moves the liquid. Heat, noise, and pressurized air are released.",https://berkeley.ca1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_0N7cUF1hRBUgyKW
Zip Disk Drive,Read a zip disk,"Humans turn on the reader and insert a zip disk, which is sensed and guided in. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy to rotate the disk and to actuate translation for the reading head. The magnetic energy from the disk is converted to electrical energy and is exported as data.",https://berkeley.ca1.qualtrics.com/ControlPanel/Graphic.php?IM=IM_e3hr3iKQmYHcbHw

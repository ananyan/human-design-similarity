Function: Humans position the object and secure it by applying force, changing its status from unclamped to clamped.","Power Razor

Function: Humans provide translational motion to the razor over the surface of their skin through their hands. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy in the razor to cut the hair and separate it from the surface of the skin. The razor releases the cut hair, heat, and noise.","Zip Disk Drive

Function: Humans turn on the reader and insert a zip disk, which is sensed and guided in. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy to rotate the disk and to actuate translation for the reading head. The magnetic energy from the disk is converted to electrical energy and is exported as data.","All-in-one Printer

Function: Humans turn the printer on and insert paper. Print data is imported to the printer and then electrical energy is used to signal the printer to release the stored liquid ink. The ink changes the blank paper to the printed paper and the print status is displayed. A scanned document is converted to a signal and exported as scan data.","DVD Player

Function: Humans insert a DVD and turn on the player. Electrical energy is used to start mechanical rotation and the lens focuses electromagnetic energy (laser) on the moving disk to read it. The electromagnetic energy is changed to electrical energy, which is used to display the video and play audio. Buttons are used to control other actions such as pause and eject.","CD Player

Function: Humans insert a CD and turn on the player. Electrical energy is used to start mechanical rotation of the CD and the lens focuses electromagnetic energy (laser) on the moving disk to read it and play the relevant audio. Buttons are used to control other actions such as pause and repeat.","CD Player

Function: Humans insert a CD and turn on the player. Electrical energy is used to start mechanical rotation of the CD and the lens focuses electromagnetic energy (laser) on the moving disk to read it and play the relevant audio. Buttons are used to control other actions such as pause and repeat.",Please briefly explain why you selected the product to be more similar.,"Zip Disk Drive

Function: Humans turn on the reader and insert a zip disk, which is sensed and guided in. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy to rotate the disk and to actuate translation for the reading head. The magnetic energy from the disk is converted to electrical energy and is exported as data.","Water Pump

Function: Humans turn the pump on. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy and then to pressurized air within the pump, which moves the liquid. Heat, noise, and pressurized air are released.","VHS Player

Function: Humans turn on the player insert the tape, which is sensed and then guided in. Electrical energy is used mechanically translate the tape and then to start mechanical rotation of the wheels. The magnetic tape reel is read and encoded into video and audio signals, which are played.  Electrical energy is also converted to electromagnetic energy (light) to indicate the status. Buttons are used to control other signals such as stop and eject.","Power Razor

Function: Humans provide translational motion to the razor over the surface of their skin through their hands. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy in the razor to cut the hair and separate it from the surface of the skin. The razor releases the cut hair, heat, and noise.","Nerf Gun

Function: Humans load the ammo, pump air into the gun, and pull a mechanical trigger. The pressurized air causes translational motion of the ammo and the gun emits noise.","Game Controller

Function: Humans push mechanical buttons or directional joysticks to actuate an electric signal. The electric signal is turned into a control signal that sends data to the connected electronic device as well as into electromagnetic energy (light) and mechanical vibration on the controller.",Please briefly explain why you selected the product to be more similar.,"Lawn Mower

Function: Humans push the lawn mower to add translational motion and turn it on. Liquid fuel is stored and the chemical energy in it is converted to mechanical energy. The mechanical energy is used to cut the grass and expel the cut grass pieces. The lawn mower releases heat, noise, and fumes.","Lawn Mower

Function: Humans push the lawn mower to add translational motion and turn it on. Liquid fuel is stored and the chemical energy in it is converted to mechanical energy. The mechanical energy is used to cut the grass and expel the cut grass pieces. The lawn mower releases heat, noise, and fumes.","Alcohol Detector

Function: Humans turn on the device and blow into it. The device collects the breath sample and uses a chemical reaction to determine and display the alcohol level.","Scooter

Function: Humans provide or stop translational motion to transport themselves.","Hulk Hands

Function: Humans place their hands in the gloves. The gloves detect and process an electrical signal from human movement. The electrical signal is converted to noise.","VHS Player

Function: Humans turn on the player insert the tape, which is sensed and then guided in. Electrical energy is used mechanically translate the tape and then to start mechanical rotation of the wheels. The magnetic tape reel is read and encoded into video and audio signals, which are played.  Electrical energy is also converted to electromagnetic energy (light) to indicate the status. Buttons are used to control other signals such as stop and eject.",Please briefly explain why you selected the product to be more similar.,"Drink Cooler

Function: Humans place the device on a surface and places a cup on top. Electrical energy is used to start mechanical rotation of a fan and extract heat. The fan expels air and the heat is transferred out.","Zip Disk Drive

Function: Read a zip disk","CD Player

Function: Read a CD","Hulk Hands

Function: Emit sound for entertainment","Water Pump

Function: Move liquid","Drink Cooler

Function: Transfer thermal energy","Alcohol Detector

Function: Measure alcohol","Lawn Mower

Function: Humans turn on the device and electrical energy is used to signal the blower or vacuum setting. Air is expelled in the blower setting. An air and debris mixture is taken in and the debris are stored in the vacuum setting.","Nerf Gun

Function: Humans load the ammo, pump air into the gun, and pull a mechanical trigger. The pressurized air causes translational motion of the ammo and the gun emits noise.","Scooter

Function: Humans provide or stop translational motion to transport themselves.","Scooter

Function: Humans place the device on a surface and places a cup on top. Electrical energy is used to start mechanical rotation of a fan and extract heat. The fan expels air and the heat is transferred out.","Drink Cooler

Function: Humans place the device on a surface and places a cup on top. Electrical energy is used to start mechanical rotation of a fan and extract heat. The fan expels air and the heat is transferred out.","Stapler

Function: Humans store staples in the stapler. Paper is positioned between the top and bottom housing of the stapler and force is applied to the top housing by the hand. The staple is separated from other staples and couples the sheets of paper together. The stapler releases the stapled pages and noise.",Please briefly explain why you selected the product to be more similar.,"Vise Grip

Function: Humans position the object and secure it by applying force, changing its status from unclamped to clamped.","Blower/Vacuum

Function: Humans insert a CD and turn on the player. Electrical energy is used to start mechanical rotation of the CD and the lens focuses electromagnetic energy (laser) on the moving disk to read it and play the relevant audio. Buttons are used to control other actions such as pause and repeat.","Toy Plane

Function: Humans pump pressurized air into the plane and throw it to give the plane translational motion. The propellors rotate.","Game Controller

Function: Humans turn on the player insert the tape, which is sensed and then guided in. Electrical energy is used mechanically translate the tape and then to start mechanical rotation of the wheels. The magnetic tape reel is read and encoded into video and audio signals, which are played.  Electrical energy is also converted to electromagnetic energy (light) to indicate the status. Buttons are used to control other signals such as stop and eject.",Select the answer that best describes you - Selected Choice,Select the answer that best describes you - Other - Text,"What is your major, program, and year? - Major","What is your major, program, and year? - Program (e.g. B.S.)","What is your major, program, and year? - Year in program",What is your role/title and background? - Role/title,What is your role/title and background? - Degree (e.g. B.S.),What is your role/title and background? - Major,What is your role/title and background? - Graduation year,"Briefly describe your experience in engineering and design.

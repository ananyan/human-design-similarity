Consent Form



By clicking the button below, you acknowledge that you are 18 years of age or above, have read the consent form, and agree to take part in this research.","Blower/Vacuum

Function: Humans turn on the device and electrical energy is used to signal the blower or vacuum setting. Air is expelled in the blower setting. An air and debris mixture is taken in and the debris are stored in the vacuum setting.","Hulk Hands

Function: Humans place their hands in the gloves. The gloves detect and process an electrical signal from human movement. The electrical signal is converted to noise.","Zip Disk Drive

Function: Humans turn on the reader and insert a zip disk, which is sensed and guided in. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy to rotate the disk and to actuate translation for the reading head. The magnetic energy from the disk is converted to electrical energy and is exported as data.","Bike

Function: Humans pedal to provide mechanical energy for translational motion to transport themselves.","CD Player

Function: Humans insert a CD and turn on the player. Electrical energy is used to start mechanical rotation of the CD and the lens focuses electromagnetic energy (laser) on the moving disk to read it and play the relevant audio. Buttons are used to control other actions such as pause and repeat.","Toy Plane

Function: Humans pump pressurized air into the plane and throw it to give the plane translational motion. The propellors rotate.","Toy Plane

Function: Humans pump pressurized air into the plane and throw it to give the plane translational motion. The propellors rotate.",Please briefly explain why you selected the product to be more similar.,"Bike

Function: Humans pedal to provide mechanical energy for translational motion to transport themselves.","Lawn Mower

Function: Humans push the lawn mower to add translational motion and turn it on. Liquid fuel is stored and the chemical energy in it is converted to mechanical energy. The mechanical energy is used to cut the grass and expel the cut grass pieces. The lawn mower releases heat, noise, and fumes.","Zip Disk Drive

Function: Humans turn on the reader and insert a zip disk, which is sensed and guided in. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy to rotate the disk and to actuate translation for the reading head. The magnetic energy from the disk is converted to electrical energy and is exported as data.","Game Controller

Function: Humans push mechanical buttons or directional joysticks to actuate an electric signal. The electric signal is turned into a control signal that sends data to the connected electronic device as well as into electromagnetic energy (light) and mechanical vibration on the controller.","Game Controller

Function: Humans push mechanical buttons or directional joysticks to actuate an electric signal. The electric signal is turned into a control signal that sends data to the connected electronic device as well as into electromagnetic energy (light) and mechanical vibration on the controller.","Stapler

Function: Humans store staples in the stapler. Paper is positioned between the top and bottom housing of the stapler and force is applied to the top housing by the hand. The staple is separated from other staples and couples the sheets of paper together. The stapler releases the stapled pages and noise.",Please briefly explain why you selected the product to be more similar.,"Blower/Vacuum

Function: Humans provide translational motion to the razor over the surface of their skin through their hands. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy in the razor to cut the hair and separate it from the surface of the skin. The razor releases the cut hair, heat, and noise.",Please briefly explain why you selected the product to be more similar.,"Toy Plane

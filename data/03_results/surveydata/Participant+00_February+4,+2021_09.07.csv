Function: Control computer","Blower/Vacuum

Function: Humans turn on the device and electrical energy is used to signal the blower or vacuum setting. Air is expelled in the blower setting. An air and debris mixture is taken in and the debris are stored in the vacuum setting.","Power Razor

Function: Humans provide translational motion to the razor over the surface of their skin through their hands. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy in the razor to cut the hair and separate it from the surface of the skin. The razor releases the cut hair, heat, and noise.","Bike

Function: Humans pedal to provide mechanical energy for translational motion to transport themselves.","Game Controller

Function: Humans push mechanical buttons or directional joysticks to actuate an electric signal. The electric signal is turned into a control signal that sends data to the connected electronic device as well as into electromagnetic energy (light) and mechanical vibration on the controller.","Nerf Gun

Function: Humans load the ammo, pump air into the gun, and pull a mechanical trigger. The pressurized air causes translational motion of the ammo and the gun emits noise.","Power Razor

Function: Humans provide translational motion to the razor over the surface of their skin through their hands. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy in the razor to cut the hair and separate it from the surface of the skin. The razor releases the cut hair, heat, and noise.","Zip Disk Drive

Function: Humans turn on the reader and insert a zip disk, which is sensed and guided in. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy to rotate the disk and to actuate translation for the reading head. The magnetic energy from the disk is converted to electrical energy and is exported as data.",Please briefly explain why you selected the product to be more similar.,"Alcohol Detector

Function: Humans turn on the device and blow into it. The device collects the breath sample and uses a chemical reaction to determine and display the alcohol level.","Power Razor

Function: Humans provide translational motion to the razor over the surface of their skin through their hands. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy in the razor to cut the hair and separate it from the surface of the skin. The razor releases the cut hair, heat, and noise.","Lawn Mower

Function: Humans push the lawn mower to add translational motion and turn it on. Liquid fuel is stored and the chemical energy in it is converted to mechanical energy. The mechanical energy is used to cut the grass and expel the cut grass pieces. The lawn mower releases heat, noise, and fumes.","Bike

Function: Humans pedal to provide mechanical energy for translational motion to transport themselves.","Power Razor

Function: Humans turn on the player insert the tape, which is sensed and then guided in. Electrical energy is used mechanically translate the tape and then to start mechanical rotation of the wheels. The magnetic tape reel is read and encoded into video and audio signals, which are played.  Electrical energy is also converted to electromagnetic energy (light) to indicate the status. Buttons are used to control other signals such as stop and eject.","Bike

Function: Humans pedal to provide mechanical energy for translational motion to transport themselves.","Quick Grip Vise

Function: Humans position the object and secure it by applying force to clamp it.","Water Pump

Function: Humans turn the pump on. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy and then to pressurized air within the pump, which moves the liquid. Heat, noise, and pressurized air are released.","Water Pump

Function: Humans turn the pump on. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy and then to pressurized air within the pump, which moves the liquid. Heat, noise, and pressurized air are released.","Stapler

Function: Humans store staples in the stapler. Paper is positioned between the top and bottom housing of the stapler and force is applied to the top housing by the hand. The staple is separated from other staples and couples the sheets of paper together. The stapler releases the stapled pages and noise.",Please briefly explain why you selected the product to be more similar.,"Zip Disk Drive

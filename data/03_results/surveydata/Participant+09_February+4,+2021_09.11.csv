Consent Form



By clicking the button below, you acknowledge that you are 18 years of age or above, have read the consent form, and agree to take part in this research.","Quick Grip Vise

Function: Humans position the object and secure it by applying force to clamp it.","Alcohol Detector

Function: Humans turn on the device and blow into it. The device collects the breath sample and uses a chemical reaction to determine and display the alcohol level.","Blower/Vacuum

Function: Humans turn on the device and electrical energy is used to signal the blower or vacuum setting. Air is expelled in the blower setting. An air and debris mixture is taken in and the debris are stored in the vacuum setting.","Water Pump

Function: Humans turn the pump on. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy and then to pressurized air within the pump, which moves the liquid. Heat, noise, and pressurized air are released.","Game Controller

Function: Humans push mechanical buttons or directional joysticks to actuate an electric signal. The electric signal is turned into a control signal that sends data to the connected electronic device as well as into electromagnetic energy (light) and mechanical vibration on the controller.","Game Controller

Function: Humans push mechanical buttons or directional joysticks to actuate an electric signal. The electric signal is turned into a control signal that sends data to the connected electronic device as well as into electromagnetic energy (light) and mechanical vibration on the controller.","All-in-one Printer

Function: Humans turn the printer on and insert paper. Print data is imported to the printer and then electrical energy is used to signal the printer to release the stored liquid ink. The ink changes the blank paper to the printed paper and the print status is displayed. A scanned document is converted to a signal and exported as scan data.",Please briefly explain why you selected the product to be more similar.,"Blower/Vacuum

Function: Humans turn on the device and electrical energy is used to signal the blower or vacuum setting. Air is expelled in the blower setting. An air and debris mixture is taken in and the debris are stored in the vacuum setting.","Power Razor

Function: Humans provide translational motion to the razor over the surface of their skin through their hands. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy in the razor to cut the hair and separate it from the surface of the skin. The razor releases the cut hair, heat, and noise.","Blower/Vacuum

Function: Humans turn on the device and electrical energy is used to signal the blower or vacuum setting. Air is expelled in the blower setting. An air and debris mixture is taken in and the debris are stored in the vacuum setting.","Stapler

Function: Humans store staples in the stapler. Paper is positioned between the top and bottom housing of the stapler and force is applied to the top housing by the hand. The staple is separated from other staples and couples the sheets of paper together. The stapler releases the stapled pages and noise.","All-in-one Printer

Function: Humans turn the printer on and insert paper. Print data is imported to the printer and then electrical energy is used to signal the printer to release the stored liquid ink. The ink changes the blank paper to the printed paper and the print status is displayed. A scanned document is converted to a signal and exported as scan data.","Nerf Gun

Function: Humans load the ammo, pump air into the gun, and pull a mechanical trigger. The pressurized air causes translational motion of the ammo and the gun emits noise.",Please briefly explain why you selected the product to be more similar.,"Quick Grip Vise

Function: Humans position the object and secure it by applying force to clamp it.","Drink Cooler

Function: Humans place the device on a surface and places a cup on top. Electrical energy is used to start mechanical rotation of a fan and extract heat. The fan expels air and the heat is transferred out.","Bike

Function: Humans pedal to provide mechanical energy for translational motion to transport themselves.","CD Player

Function: Humans insert a CD and turn on the player. Electrical energy is used to start mechanical rotation of the CD and the lens focuses electromagnetic energy (laser) on the moving disk to read it and play the relevant audio. Buttons are used to control other actions such as pause and repeat.","Alcohol Detector

Function: Humans turn on the device and blow into it. The device collects the breath sample and uses a chemical reaction to determine and display the alcohol level.","Quick Grip Vise

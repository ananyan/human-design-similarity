Function: Transfer thermal energy","Bike

Function: Humans pedal to provide mechanical energy for translational motion to transport themselves.","Game Controller

Function: Humans push mechanical buttons or directional joysticks to actuate an electric signal. The electric signal is turned into a control signal that sends data to the connected electronic device as well as into electromagnetic energy (light) and mechanical vibration on the controller.","Hulk Hands

Function: Humans place their hands in the gloves. The gloves detect and process an electrical signal from human movement. The electrical signal is converted to noise.","Drink Cooler

Function: Humans place the device on a surface and places a cup on top. Electrical energy is used to start mechanical rotation of a fan and extract heat. The fan expels air and the heat is transferred out.","Scooter

Function: Humans place their hands in the gloves. The gloves detect and process an electrical signal from human movement. The electrical signal is converted to noise.","Blower/Vacuum

Function: Humans turn on the device and electrical energy is used to signal the blower or vacuum setting. Air is expelled in the blower setting. An air and debris mixture is taken in and the debris are stored in the vacuum setting.","Water Pump

Function: Humans turn the pump on. Electrical energy is converted to mechanical energy and then to pressurized air within the pump, which moves the liquid. Heat, noise, and pressurized air are released.","Water Pump

Function: Humans position the object and secure it by applying force, changing its status from unclamped to clamped.","Lawn Mower

Function: Humans push the lawn mower to add translational motion and turn it on. Liquid fuel is stored and the chemical energy in it is converted to mechanical energy. The mechanical energy is used to cut the grass and expel the cut grass pieces.
